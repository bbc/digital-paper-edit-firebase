# Taxonomy

**Transcript :** text + timecodes references, associated to audio or video file, generally of an interview or spoke words. Generally a json representation in dev context, or a text document in editorial context.

**Highlights:** text selections marked as standing out or useful in a transcript for a story. 

Note that not all Highlights/text selection will make it to the final version of the story.

**Labels:** Highlights can be grouped into categories, through the use of labels.

Each label has a name, description and colour. 

There should be a default label, with default colour for uncategorised Highlights.

**Annotation:** As we have seen an Highlight can have a label, and labels can have a description.

The  description of a hilight through a label is an annotation. (there might be “no label”, if the default label is being used)

**Paper-cuts:** Text selection from transcript, added to a story.

This may or may not include parts of Highlights selection. 

It retain informations aroud the transcript it belongs to, and the speaker associated with it.

**Paper-edit:** It’s made off paper-cuts.

**Voice over script:** It’s a narration the journalist writes to “link”/connect all the quotes(text selections) from various contributors in the interview transcripts.

**Program Script:** It contains the “paper-edit” but also the voice over. 

It may contain other elements that specify how the program should be assemble in an audio or video editing software sequence. eg GV/B-Roll, sound effects, images, animations etc..
